# Custom zsh template

This theme is basically just the default theme for oh-my-zsh "robbyrussel" but with some custom colours and a "sysmsg" function that sends out a quick message on startup and exit.

You can download and use this by putting the theme in your custom themes directory and changing `ZSH_THEME` in your ~/.zshrc file to "connor". By default the custom themes directory is `.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/`, so that's where it'll be if you haven't configured it!
